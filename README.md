# Simple Queue

A reliable, easy-to-use message queue system built on Cloudflare Workers. Open-source alternative to paid services like Zeplo or Qstash.

The queue for people only know What's API and how to make requests

Read in [Portuguese](README-pt.md)

## Why Choose Simple Queue?

- Set up once
- Scales with your needs without changing configurations
- Pay only for what you use
- You need only to know what an API is and how to make HTTP requests
- You need to run automations or actions that take a long time, and at the same time limit actions to avoid overloading your server.

Imagine sending messages between your apps without worrying about them getting lost or your systems crashing. Simple Queue makes it simple and affordable!

### Key Benefits:

- **Easy Setup**: Set it up once and forget about it. No complex server configurations needed.
- **Pay Only for What You Use**: Serverless technology means you only pay for actual usage – save money!
- **Reliable Delivery**: Messages are stored safely and delivered even if your apps are busy or offline.
- **Automatic Retries**: If something goes wrong, it tries again automatically.
- **Organize Your Messages**: Group messages by app or task to keep things tidy.
- **No Tech Experts Needed**: Works with simple HTTP requests – if you know APIs, you're good to go.
- **Cost-Effective**: No need for expensive DevOps teams or infrastructure.
- **Secure**: Protect your messages with API keys.

## How It Works

1. **Send Messages**: Your app sends messages via simple HTTP requests.
2. **Store Safely**: Messages are stored in a reliable queue.
3. **Process Automatically**: A scheduler picks up messages and sends them to your destination apps.
4. **Handle Errors**: If delivery fails, it retries or moves to a "dead letter" queue for review.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Project**: Download the code from GitHub.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install`.
3. **Run Locally**: Use `npm run dev` to test on your machine.
4. **Deploy**: Run `npm run deploy` to put it live on Cloudflare.
5. **Set Up Scheduler**: Use Supabase to create a simple cron job that processes messages every few seconds.

For detailed setup, check the [full documentation](#how-to-run) below.

## Features

- **Message Publishing**: Send messages to the queue easily.
- **Automatic Processing**: Handles delivery in the background.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Keeps trying if things don't work the first time.
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed messages go here for manual review.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids sending the same message twice.
- **Group Organization**: Separate messages by app or task.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures messages match expected formats.

## Architecture Overview

## Performance & Costs

- **Low Cost**: Processing 1 million messages costs around $5.
  - 1 million Cloudflare Workers to publish: $0.33
  - 1 million Cloudflare Workers to consume the messages: $0.33
  - 1 million Cloudflare Durable Objects storage for the queue's data: $2
  - 1 million Cloudflare Durable Objects get and delete the queue's data: $2 (update register when consuming the message and delete operation when message processed successfully)
- **Scalable**: Grows with your needs without extra setup.

## Technical Details (For Developers)

### Technologies Used

- Cloudflare Workers
- Durable Objects (SQLite storage)
- Node.js & TypeScript
- Supabase (for scheduling)

### Full Setup Instructions

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` for local development
- Run `npm run deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare Workers
- Import the Insomnia collection `Insomnia_2026-01-11.yaml` for testing

### Setting Up Groups

Edit `groups.json` to add new groups (e.g., user_queue, product_queue).

### Data Validation

Use [this tool](https://transform.tools/json-to-zod) to generate validation schemas and add them to `src/schemas-validation.ts`.

### Scheduler Setup

Create a Supabase account and set up a cron job:

```sql
select net.http_get(
    url:='YOUR_QUEUE_URL/process',
    headers:=jsonb_build_object('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY'),
    timeout_milliseconds:=60000
);
```

### Environment Variables

- `API_KEY`: Protects your application
- `HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds
- `TOTAL_RETRIES_BEFORE_DQL`: Retry attempts before dead letter
- `TOTAL_MESSAGES_PULL_PER_TIME`: Messages processed per batch

### Limitations (Free Tier)

- 128MB memory limit
- 1,000 requests/minute
- 100,000 writes/day

### Load Test Results

Find scripts in `loadtest/` folder. Sample performance:

- 3k requests in 14.35s
- Average latency: 568ms
- Up to 1,188 req/sec
